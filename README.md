CodeIgniter SQL Server Driver
=============================

PHP 5.3+ for Windows no longer supports the mssql functions because Microsoft are no longer supporting the underlying libraries used.

Microsoft have developed a new set of drivers for SQL Server which they have committed to actively develop and support. These drivers can be downloaded here [http://sqlsrvphp.codeplex.com/](http://sqlsrvphp.codeplex.com/ "http://sqlsrvphp.codeplex.com/").

This CodeIgniter fork will add support for these new drivers into the framework.
